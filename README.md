## This Uses a caption generator model (gpt2 image captioning) for converitng image to text(captions).

## Then it uses bard api to change the basic caption to various interesting prompts.(ChatGPT was not taken beacuse the wait time for the response was too long.)

## The Captions are a little less interactive as compared to chatGPT but are good enough.(with the timetrade off I think bard does a better job.)

## It uses gradio as an user interface.

## The image to text(caption) generator is not that great, due to this sometimes there are some errors in image interpretation.
